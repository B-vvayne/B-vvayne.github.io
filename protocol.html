                        2.(1) For adherent cells:
                        The clean cover slips were soaked in 70% ethanol and then placed into the petri dish with clean,
                        sterile forceps, and the residual ethanol was washed away with sterile PBS. After the cells are
                        close to growth, the cover glass is removed and operated carefully to prevent the cells from
                        desating.

                        Including: organic solvent (methanol, ethanol, acetone, etc.); crosslinker (4% PFA, 10% neutral
                        formalin), the choice of fixative depends on the nature of the studied antigen and the
                        characteristics of the antibody used, however, formaldehyde is the most, but for phosphorylated

                        substrate (100 µL) was added to each well and incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. To stop the
                        reaction, 50 µL of 2 M sulfuric acid was added to each well. One-hundred microliters of the
                        final reaction was transferred to 96-well plate and measured the absorbance at 450 and 650 nm.
                        The relative amount of displayed peptide was measured by subtracting absorbance at 450 nm with
                        absorbance 650 nm.

                        The 50 µL of cTFF2 was applied onto the tissue sample and cover with the second layer of tissue
                        fixed to SEM pin stub. These layered tissue–hydrogel–tissue sandwiches were kept at room
                        temperature for 30 min to achieve integration of the hydrogel with the gut mucosa. Finally, SEM
                        pin stubs with hydrogel and tissue samples were loaded on the bottom stage of the mechanical
                        tester (ADMET) and pulled off with a constant strain of 8 mm min−1. The applied force was
                        monitored and the maximum force before full detachment of the patch was measured as the adhesion
                        force. All the experiments were performed in triplicate.

                        1.Cell culture
                        <br>Caco-2 cells (C2BBe1 [clone of Caco-2] (ATCC® CRL2102™)) were maintained and passaged in
                        Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplied with 4.5 g L−1 glucose and glutamax, 15% fetal
                        bovine serum (FBS) and 1% Penicillin–Streptomycin (Gibco) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C, 5%
                        CO2. For the translocation assay, epithelial integrity and IL-8 production experiments, Caco-2
                        cells were grown to confluence on 3.0 μm semipermeable tissue culture inserts (24 wells,
                        Transwell, Corning). After 14–21 days, the cell monolayers achieved a polarized, differentiated
                        state and the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) reached 1000–1200 Ω cm−2.

                        2.Electron microscopy
                        <br>Two-hundred microliters of the testing cultures were filtered onto Nucleopore Track-Etched
                        membranes (0.22 μm pore size) under vacuum and placed in fixative solution (2% glutaraldehyde
                        and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer) for 2 h at room temperature. After
                        fixation, the membranes were gently rinsed with water and subjected to an ethanol gradient (25,
                        50, 75, 100, and 100% (volume per volume)) with a 15 min incubation for each concentration. The
                        samples were then transferred to a critical point dryer). The dried membranes were placed on
                        Scanning Electron Microscopy sample holders with carbon adhesives and sputter coated with 80:20
                        Pt:Pd (5 nm-thick). A Zeiss Ultra 55 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope was used to
                        image the samples.

                        3.Invasion assay
                        <br>Caco-2 cells at passage 5–15 were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 105 cells per
                        well in
                        500 μL of regular cell culture media and grown to 90% confluency. The bacterial cultures were
                        pelleted, washed with PBS and diluted to an OD600 of 0.5 in DMEM with 1 g L−1 glucose and 1%
                        FBS. The Caco-2 cells were rinsed twice with PBS to remove the antibiotic before addition of the
                        bacteria (500 μL). Bacteria were incubated for 2 h with the Caco-2 cells and removed by
                        aspiration. The Caco-2 cells were then washed twice with 500 μL PBS before receiving 500 μL of
                        DMEM, 1 g L−1 glucose, 1% FBS, and 100 μg mL−1 gentamicin. After 1 h of incubation, the media
                        were aspirated and replaced with 1 mL of 1% Triton-X. The cells were incubated with Triton-X at
                        37 °C for 10 min and repeatedly pipetted to homogenize. Each well was serially diluted and
                        plated on kanamycin plates to count the colony-forming units (CFU) of bacteria that had invaded
                        the Caco-2 cells.

                        4.Translocation assay
                        <br>EcN variants and S. Typhimurium SL 1344 were grown and induced, if applicable, in LB media
                        with
                        appropriate antibiotics, pelleted, washed with PB,S and diluted to OD600 of 0.01 in DMEM with 1%
                        glucose and 1% FBS. One day before the experiment, the culture media of polarized Caco-2 were
                        switched to their corresponding non-antibiotic counterparts with 1% glucose and 1% FBS.
                        Six-hundred microliters of diluted cultures were used to infect polarized Caco-2 apically. After
                        5 h of incubation, 100 μL of media were collected from apical and basolateral sides of the
                        transwell, serially diluted and plated on antibiotic selective plates to enumerate percentage of
                        translocated bacteria.
